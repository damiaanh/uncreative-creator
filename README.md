UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Uncreative Creator scrapes given subreddits for their top-rated videos. It then downloads these and edits them to one large video. This video is then uploaded to Youtube.

It's idea came from the appearance of youtube videos with titles like "videos I saw on reddit" and an interest to automate such process.
Currently working on creating one large video.
